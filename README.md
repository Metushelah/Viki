This git is to create a project of visualising Wikipedia to allow viewing it more like a mind map.

Vision: 
The idea is to make the connections between the different wikipedia pages more visible, and easier for a human eye to grasp.

Mission:
We believe that it is easier to learn and grasp when you can see the context within which each subject or idea is placed and so would like to show each page of Wikipedia in it's place relative to it's other pages in the field.


Design:
Right now each page is a stand alone unit when viewed with the links (only) highlighted in blue. Problem is that when you are trying to understand quickly where this page stands relativly to others, you need to sift through a bunch of links and reading more than a few lines. It seems that it would be easier to create a sort of Mind-Map for the different pages, showing each page and how it connects with it's different parent concept(s), its equal or sibling concept(s) and it's daughter pages.

A parent page is defined by something that:
- created the daugther page (metalica -> master of puppets album)
- is a higher concept that leads to the daughter page (physics -> general relativity )
- 

A sibling or similar page would be:
- other things created by the same parent page (Metalica -> ride the lightning)
- different concepts but similar in a way (general relativity -> quantum theory)
- 

a daughter page would be:
- things created by parent
- specific examples of the parent
- 


It would look like a mind map each constituting it's concept group. Currently viewed page in the middle and to the right (or left) not taking all the screen. Pages can be "opened" which will expand them to fill most of the screen and later can be reduced again to look at the map again.

In reduced mode or MapMode, you will mainly see the pages titles and the different connections to it's parent pages, siblings and daughter pages. 
parent pages will be placed at the top and cascading down it's conncections.
siblings pages will be placed horizontally close to it's similar "concept group". Most relevent connection will be closer to the current page while farther in the relevence would be farther out.
Daughter concept will be placed at the bottom, it's connections leading up.

Background color would be stary black/blue space with a coloring shade overlapping like a cloud relative to the page you are viewing (Bibliography, History, Science, Art, etc) with shades merging togather when the concept is cross-field-wise.


The connection themselves can be based on the site: http://www.freebase.com/browse before it is shut down...
and later will be added from wiki-contributors (using a ranking system?).

This will allow to see each page relative to other pages straight away, and will allow to understand you position in the field you are viewing relative to the whole (something you cannot do right now without alot of work).


Uses:
1) Building or Self learning courses where you can pick a topic and run through it from it's begining to the end, the same with subtopics etc.
2) 


Yet to be Decided stuff:
Clustering ideas:
1) circles, each idea is placed in a circle in it's group (parent, sibling, daughter) and the user revolves the circle to scroll through the conncection. When looking at those other pages the connection leading to it from the current page will highlight and stand out.
2) cloud group, other pages in the group simply float around the current page and when mouse is hovered over they enlarge and the conncetion is highlited.
3) suns system, with the pages arranged as a sun around the conncetion types?

Conncection based on what?
Connection ranking system?
Types of connections?

Type of extension? plugin or what?
